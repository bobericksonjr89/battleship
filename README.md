# Battleship

The game! Find and sink your opponent's ships before they find yours.

## Description

Users are able to place ships of various sizes on their gameboard, and then take turns against the enemy AI in selecting coordinates to find and sink their opponent's ships.

## Structure

Ship, Player, and Gameboard factory functions come with all attributes and methods needed for basic functionality. The app module then stiches everything together with game-flow logic, and the DOM module controls the DOM manipulation.

## TDD

Crucial interactive components related to the Player and Gameboard objects are constructed using Testing Driven Development and Jest.
